## What's Left to Build

### üî¥ Critical (MVP Blockers)

1. **LLM Integration**

   - Current Status: TODO comment in dequeue function
   - Needed:
     - Choose LLM provider
     - Design prompt template
     - Implement API call
     - Parse responses
     - Error handling
   - Impact: Without this, no real quizzes can be generated

2. **Quiz Taking Interface** (`/quizzes/[quizId]`)

   - Current Status: Page exists but empty
   - Needed:
     - Fetch quiz data
     - Display questions sequentially
     - 7-point scale input (-3 to +3)
     - Progress tracking
     - Submit answers
   - Impact: Core user experience

3. **Results Calculation & Display** (`/quizzes/[quizId]/results`)
   - Current Status: Page exists but empty
   - Needed:
     - Calculate scores from answers
     - Determine personality type
     - Display results with details
     - Share functionality
   - Impact: Core user experience

### üü° High Priority (Important Features)

   - Current Status: Pages exist but empty
   - Needed:
     - List quizzes with pagination
     - Implement trending logic
     - Sort by date
     - Search/filter
   - Impact: Discovery and engagement

5. **User Dashboard** (`/mypage`, `/mypage/quizzes/[quizId]`)

   - Current Status: Basic structure only
   - Needed:
     - List user's created quizzes
     - Show quiz status (pending/ready/published)
     - Edit quiz metadata
     - Delete quizzes
     - View statistics
   - Impact: User management and control

6. **Favorites System** (`/mypage/favorite`)
   - Current Status: Page exists but empty
   - Needed:
     - Favorite/unfavorite functionality
     - List favorited quizzes
     - Database table for favorites
   - Impact: User engagement

### üü¢ Medium Priority (Enhancements)

7. **Loading & Status Indicators**

   - Quiz generation in progress
   - Loading states during navigation
   - Success/error notifications

8. **Error Handling**

   - Form validation errors
   - API call failures
   - Network issues
   - User-friendly error messages

9. **Database Security**

   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies
   - Proper access controls
   - Data validation

10. **User Feedback System**
    - Toast notifications
    - Success messages
    - Loading spinners

### üîµ Low Priority (Nice to Have)

11. **Quiz Analytics**

    - View count
    - Completion rate
    - Popular results

12. **Social Features**

    - Share on social media
    - Quiz comments/reviews
    - User profiles

13. **Advanced Quiz Features**
    - Quiz categories/tags
    - Quiz images
    - Multiple quiz formats

## Current Status

### Project Phase

**Early Development** - Core infrastructure complete, building out features

### Completion Estimate

- Infrastructure: 80%
- Core Features: 30%
- User Experience: 40%
- Testing: 5%
- Production Readiness: 20%

### Active Development Areas

1. Planning LLM integration strategy
2. Designing quiz-taking flow
3. Database schema refinements

### Blocked/Waiting

- LLM provider selection decision needed
- Environment variables configuration (may need verification)
- Database RLS policy definition

## Known Issues

### üêõ Bugs

None identified yet (limited testing so far)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt

1. **Inconsistent Form Handling**

   - Login uses server actions
   - Quiz creation uses client-side function
   - Should standardize approach

2. **Missing TypeScript**

   - Project uses JavaScript
   - Type safety would prevent errors
   - Migration could be beneficial

3. **Limited Error Handling**

   - Few try-catch blocks
   - No error boundary components
   - Silent failures possible

4. **No Testing**
   - No unit tests
   - No integration tests
   - No E2E tests

### üîí Security Concerns

1. **RLS Policies** - Not visible in current code, may not be configured
2. **Input Validation** - Server-side validation needed
3. **Rate Limiting** - Edge Functions may need limits
4. **CORS** - Currently allows all origins (`*`)

### üìä Performance Considerations

1. **No Caching** - Every request hits database
2. **No Pagination** - Could be slow with many quizzes
3. **No Image Optimization** - If images are added later
4. **Bundle Size** - Not yet optimized

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions

**Decision: Queue-Based Processing**

- When: Initial architecture
- Why: LLM calls take time, prevent timeouts
- Status: Implemented and working
- Impact: Enables reliable async processing

**Decision: Supabase as Backend**

- When: Project start
- Why: All-in-one solution (DB, Auth, Functions)
- Status: Fully integrated
- Impact: Faster development, less infrastructure management

**Decision: Next.js App Router**

- When: Project start
- Why: Modern React patterns, server components
- Status: Implemented throughout
- Impact: Better performance, SEO-ready

### Technology Decisions

**Decision: React 19 + Next.js 16**

- When: Project start
- Why: Latest features, future-proof
- Status: Working well
- Impact: Access to newest React features

**Decision: Tailwind + DaisyUI**

- When: Project start
- Why: Rapid UI development, consistency
- Status: Used extensively
- Impact: Fast UI iteration, consistent design

**Decision: JavaScript (not TypeScript)**

- When: Project start
- Why: Faster initial development
- Status: Current implementation
- Impact: Less boilerplate, but less type safety
- Future: May migrate to TypeScript

### Data Model Decisions

**Decision: Separate quiz_element_score Table**

- When: Database schema design
- Why: Flexible scoring per result type
- Status: Implemented
- Impact: Enables complex personality typing

**Decision: PGMQ for Message Queue**

- When: Early development
- Why: PostgreSQL-native, simpler than external queue
- Status: Working
- Impact: One less external dependency

### Feature Decisions

**Decision: 7-Point Scale for Questions**

- When: Design phase
- Why: More nuanced than yes/no or 5-point
- Status: Defined in schema
- Impact: Better personality differentiation

**Decision: Dynamic Result Types**

- When: Quiz creation design
- Why: User flexibility, not limited to preset types
- Status: Implemented in form
- Impact: Unlimited quiz variety

**Decision: Mock Data in Dequeue**

- When: Initial implementation
- Why: Demonstrate flow before LLM integration
- Status: Currently active
- Impact: Can test UI before LLM ready

## Next Session Priorities

### Must Do

3. Test quiz generation end-to-end

### Should Do

4. Implement quiz display page
5. Create answer submission logic
6. Build results calculation

7. Add loading indicators
8. Improve error handling
9. Start on quiz browsing

The critical path is clear: LLM integration unlocks the entire user experience. Once quizzes can be actually generated, the quiz-taking and results flow becomes testable and refinable.
